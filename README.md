## Day 1:
## Introduction to RISC-V ISA and GNU compiler toolchain

### Introduction to RISC-V basic Keywords
---

1. **Pseudo Instruction:** A mnemonic or symbolic representation used in assembly language programming that simplifies coding but is translated into one or more actual machine instructions by the assembler.

2. **Base Integer Instruction (RV32I):** The fundamental set of instructions in the RISC-V architecture is designed for 32-bit integer operations, forming the core of RISC-V instruction sets.

3. **Multiply Extension (RV32M):** An optional extension to the RISC-V architecture that adds hardware support for integer multiplication operations, enhancing computational capabilities.

4. **Single and Double precision floating point extensions (RV64F and RV64D):** Extensions to the RISC-V architecture that provide support for single-precision (RV64F) and double-precision (RV64D) floating-point arithmetic operations, enabling efficient handling of real numbers.

5. **Application Binary Interface (ABI):** A set of conventions and rules that govern the interaction between different software components, defining aspects such as function calling conventions, data representation, and system call interfaces.

6. **Memory allocation and stack pointer:** Memory allocation refers to reserving and managing memory space for variables and data structures. In contrast, a stack pointer is a register or memory location that keeps track of the top of the call stack, facilitating function calls and local variable storage in a program.

### Lab 1
- Writing a C code and running it in a compiler.

- Now we will compile this in a RISC-V gcc compiler using this command (this command is in place of `gcc <filename>.c` in GCC compiler), which will generate `sum1ton.o` file.
```
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -o1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum1ton.o sum1ton.c
``` 
- To get the Assembly code of our program, we use this command:

```
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum1ton.o
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum1ton.o | less
```
- This assembly code is generated in RISC-V architecture for the main function (having address 10184), which is byte addressable and takes 34 instructions to execute the main function [(1020c-10184)/4 = 22]

- Now, instead of using `-o1` if we use `-ofast` it uses fewer instructions to execute the same program.

```
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -ofast -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum1ton.o sum1ton.c
``` 

- Now, to debug the assembly code, we use the following commands.
```
spike pk sum1ton.o       //this command is in place of `./a.out` in GCC compiler, which gives the same answer as in the GCC compiler
spike -d pk sum1ton.o    // to open a debugger
until pc 0 10184         // to run PC until the address of the main function
reg 0 sp                 // command to find the content of the stack pointer
reg <core_no> <register name> // command to find the content of register

```

## All commands of linux
---
- `leafpad <file_name>.c` Command to make a c file in leafpad.
- To run the .c file use `gcc <filename>.c`(if there are no errors in the code we will get an executable file with the default name a.out) then run this executable by executing `./a.out'.
- `cat <filename>.c` is used to display the contents of a file with a .c extension in the terminal
- `| less` combination is commonly used to paginate and view long text output one screen at a time.
